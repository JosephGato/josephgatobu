        <h1>A Memoir: Must've Been Fate</h1>
        <p>It all began with numbers. Mathematics—it was as if the world itself had written its laws in the language of equations, and I was simply trying to decipher them. But back then, I knew nothing more than the fact that I must attend school, where the classroom was a world within itself, detached from the happenings outside. I didn't care much about the noise beyond those walls.</p>

        <p>In time, math became more than just a subject. It evolved into something fascinating, a foundation that, when paired with physics, chemistry, and biology, created a world of pure logic and discovery. It was a puzzle—a universe where everything connected, where numbers explained the unexplained, and I was in awe.</p>

        <p>Then, slowly, my gaze shifted from numbers to something new, something I hadn’t anticipated—<span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/computer" target="_blank">computers</a></span>. I was drawn in by the allure of technology, the sleek gadgets, the hum of machines, the promise of possibilities. Music was my first love in the tech world. I marveled at how seamlessly devices could blend art with engineering, turning sound into waves, and waves into something that moved souls.</p>

        <p>From there, tech became <span class="highlight"><a href="https://josephgatobu.netlify.app/" target="_blank">my thing</a></span>—a growing passion that pulled me deeper. With each discovery, each piece of hardware, each line of code, I felt the shift within me. IT wasn’t just a hobby anymore; it was becoming a part of my identity.</p>

        <p>And then came something even more powerful—<span class="highlight"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_(computer_science)" target="_blank">data</a></span>. The way it flowed, the way it revealed patterns, how it could shape the future. I was hooked. Information, knowledge, wisdom—they all seemed like keys to unlocking some grand secret, a mystery that I was determined to unravel. <span class="highlight">Grace</span>, it seemed, had led me here.</p>

        <p>Years later, I found myself pursuing a degree in <span class="highlight"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science" target="_blank">Data Science, Computer Technology, and Networking</a></span>. Each subject was a revelation, each challenge a thrill. It was more than education; it was a <span class="highlight">revolution</span> in my mind. Technology was no longer just a tool—it was a bridge to endless possibilities, a world where solutions met problems, where creativity met logic. It became clear: this was my calling.</p>

        <p>Today, I stand proud as a <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/finding-a-job/what-is-information-technologist" target="_blank">competent Information Technologist</a></span>, armed with a <span class="highlight">Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</span> from <span class="highlight"><a href="https://www.jkuat.ac.ke/" target="_blank"></a>Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology</span>. I walked away with more than just a degree—I left with a vision and a passion for what lies ahead.</p>

        <p>My journey has equipped me with a rich toolkit—skills in <span class="highlight">Graphic Design</span>, <span class="highlight">Software Programming</span>, and development, and a deep understanding of how to thrive in a <span class="highlight">Client/Server Computer Environment</span>. But the story doesn’t end here.</p>

        <p>The future beckons, and with it, a call to <span class="highlight">direct my proven technical systems technology skills</a></span> towards projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible. There’s a hunger in me—a drive to take theory and practice, to merge creativity with logic, and to build systems that make a difference.</p>

        <p><b><align=<center>It’s been quite the journey—from math to machines, from curiosity to competence. Must’ve been fate that led me here.</b></center></p>
